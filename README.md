# Very simple and minimalistic ToDo web-application

This is my first web application written in the Django framework. The interface is simple. In addition, I used pure HTML, CSS and JS.

### Installation
Before installing dependences, download and install Python 3.x.x. [from official site](https://www.python.org/). I'm using `Python 3.11.7`
